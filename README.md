# pilot_Arne
This repository contains scripts to analyze Arne's pilot data. The main script for a simple averaging analysis is singlesubject_averaging.m. The other .m-files are helper functions. 
Because the exported .oxy3-file seems to be corrupted, I've added data_raw.mat and event.mat, so you can skip the first steps.
